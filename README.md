## About

Teaching the Machine About Colors

Harnessing collective intelligence on the web to teach the machine about the abstraction of color.

The idea for the application is to crowdsource the mapping for color names to their decimal values and provide services to exploit this information in aggregate, specifically: names-to-numbers and numbers-to-names.
